**The Problem**


A project that encompasses a new mode of programming, A Counterfactual One.

A daring speculation is therefore that all the laws of physics could be formulated solely in terms of principles about counterfactuals, and that the laws of motion follow from them as derivative, and perhaps approximate, properties. 

Exploring this possibility is the start of an **exciting research programme**.


The Science of Can and Can’t sets out in nontechnical terms a new,
counterfactual mode of explanation based on scientific and philosophical
ideas that the author, Chiara Marletto, and I have pioneered. They provide
new tools and new principles to address a number of notorious problems in
physics and beyond. - Marletto


Since the Enlightenment, technological progress has depended specifically on the creation of explanatory knowledge.


Physical systems are objects that exist in the real world, which we attempt to describe via
theory. In the mathematical sciences, we invoke mathematical objects (e.g. scalars, vectors, 
tensors) to represent the state of a physical system. - Kuyper
