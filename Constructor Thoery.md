Constructor theory is a meta-theory with its own physical principles that are intended to supplement and constrain dynamical theories, such as quantum theory and general relativity, which therefore we call subsidiary theories, [8]. Every subsidiary theory that is constructor-theory compliant must provide a set of allowed states of the allowed substrates, endowed with a topology. - Marletto

**Constructor Theory** forms **Principles** about **counterfactuals** that are stated by saying what **tasks** are **possible**, what are **impossible**, and **why**.

In constructor theory all laws of physics are stated by saying what tasks are possible, what are impossible, and why. They are principles, which underlie and supplement the existing most fundamental theories of physics.
