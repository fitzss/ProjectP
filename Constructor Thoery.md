Constructor theory is a meta-theory with its own physical principles that are intended to supplement and constrain dynamical theories, such as quantum theory and general relativity, which therefore we call subsidiary theories, [8]. Every subsidiary theory that is constructor-theory compliant must provide a set of allowed states of the allowed substrates, endowed with a topology. - Marletto
