 I think we do not have the slightest clue how to make an AGI. I think what's standing between us and making an AGI is an explanatory theory. It'll be largely a philosophical theory rather than a computer science theory or mathematics or physics or anything like that. It'll be a new way of looking at what creativity is, what explanation is. And I think that qua computation, qua computer program, I would expect it to be very simple. Relatively simple. So it's not going to be reached by more and more billions and trillions of bits of data, that's not the kind of thing it is. We differ from monkeys, who have brains very similar to ours, or apes, the great apes, we differ from the great apes only by a few K of code.
